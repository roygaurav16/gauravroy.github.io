                        <p>This is the intial start of the blogging in which I would start putting some effort to write some lines and post it as a header</p>

						<blockquote class="blockquote">Art</blockquote>
                        <p>An art form requires always a start, and the courage to make the first lines on the page, which provides the eventual structure and foundation for the art. I have faced a similar adversity in pottery, in which the first slab of clay is the hardest to form and currently I am scared during the "day beating" process about, if I am able to obtain a mold, which can be used for my future art form.</p>
                        <p>The solution to overcome the fear of a fresh paper, is having an intention before starting an artwork, so that I know where should the structure tend towards rather than meandering on a random plane. Not to say that meandering is part of the art itself.</p>  
                        <h2 class="section-heading">Scramble-スクランブル</h2>
						<blockquote class="blockquote">Jit-Jitsu, Career</blockquote>
                        <p>In wrestling and jiu-jitsu, there are moments of chaos which lead to chaos or opportunities. The chaos or opportunities in combat sports are termed as scrambles, which capture the ethos of the moment during a fight. Certainly, the duration of a fight spans approximately from 5 to 6 minutes. Within the duration of the fight, during the scramble window, the fight can completely change based on who is more engaged in the fight, patient, and making the correct reads during the fight. The aspect of scramble and patience can be extrapolated to the politics at work, or in a relationship, or opportunities with humans. In each type of scramble, we are forced to react in the moment, where awareness has to be present about the surroundings.</p>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">Place_holder</h2>
                        <p>As we got further and further away, it [the Earth] diminished in size. Finally it shrank to the size of a marble, the most beautiful you can imagine. That beautiful, warm, living object looked so fragile, so delicate, that if you touched it with a finger it would crumble and fall apart. Seeing this has to change a man.</p>
