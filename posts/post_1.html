						<blockquote class="blockquote">Art</blockquote>
                        <p>An art form requires always a start, and the courage to make the first lines on the page, which provides the eventual structure and foundation for the art. I have faced a similar adversity in pottery, in which the first slab of clay is the hardest to form and currently I am scared during the "day beating" process about, if I am able to obtain a mold, which can be used for my future art form.</p>
                        <p>The solution to overcome the fear of a fresh paper, is having an intention before starting an artwork, so that I know where should the structure tend towards rather than meandering on a random plane. Not to say that meandering is part of the art itself.</p>

						<blockquote class="blockquote">Jit-Jitsu, Career</blockquote>
                        <p>In wrestling and jiu-jitsu, there are moments of chaos which lead to chaos or opportunities. The chaos or opportunities in combat sports are termed as scrambles, which capture the ethos of the moment during a fight. Certainly, the duration of a fight spans approximately from 5 to 6 minutes. Within the duration of the fight, during the scramble window, the fight can completely change based on who is more engaged in the fight, patient, and making the correct reads during the fight. The aspect of scramble and patience can be extrapolated to the politics at work, or in a relationship, or opportunities with humans. In each type of scramble, we are forced to react in the moment, where awareness has to be present about the surroundings.</p>
						<h2 class="section-heading">Rest Days</h2>
						<blockquote class="blockquote">Jit-Jitsu, Career</blockquote>
						<p>Dustin Porter and Alexander Volkonoski, in the years 2023 and 2024, have been open about their mental health and the challenge of not being able to find peace without a concrete goal. The absence of a concrete goal can lead to wandering aimlessly, which in turn can lead to addiction problems such as drinking, gambling, or overeating (Mara in Buddhism). The concept of simply living and being present with one's thoughts is a challenge that humans face. Just being with your thoughts and meditating on them is difficult since we need to discern what matters and what does not. Most of our thoughts are mere projections that may never come to fruition.</p>
						<h2 class="section-heading">Headspace for creativity</h2>
						<blockquote class="blockquote">Art, Career,21.04.2024</blockquote>
						<p>In Mare Ruben's book on creativity, he delves deeply into esoteric themes, emphasizing the necessity of spiritual connection for artistic creation. He argues that art isn't merely produced but rather brought forth from the depths of the artist's mind, positioning the artist as a conduit for its expression. This concept echoes through various disciplines, including science, which he sees as another form of artistry.Creating art, Ruben suggests, requires the right combination of medium and mindset. Personally, I've often observed that any kind of stressor in life disrupts this creative headspace. Whether physical challenges, emotional turmoil, or financial pressures, these stressors can profoundly affect one's ability to tap into their artistic flow. However, in the long run, the persistence and depth of one's love for their art ultimately determine their return to it despite such obstacles.</p>
						<h2 class="section-heading">Dilution of values</h2>
						<blockquote class="blockquote">Career,21.04.2024</blockquote>
						<p>I'm not a 68-year-old conservative man lamenting the changing world. Rather, I've noticed a trend across various arts such as BJJ and Yoga, as well as in disciplines like karate. Initially, these arts enter the scene with a defined structure, but over time, they begin to branch out into different styles. This evolution mirrors the trajectory of religions, where practitioners bring their own interpretations to the practice, sometimes improving upon it, while others seek to commercialize and make it more accessible.</p>
                        <p>It's crucial for individuals to reflect on why they're drawn to and practice these arts in the first place. Whether it's for recreation, personal growth, or healing, understanding one's motivation can deepen the experience and ensure alignment with personal goals and values.</p>
