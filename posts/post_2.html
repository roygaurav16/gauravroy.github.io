						<blockquote class="blockquote">Jit-Jitsu, Career</blockquote>
                        <p>In wrestling and jiu-jitsu, there are moments of chaos which lead to chaos or opportunities. The chaos or opportunities in combat sports are termed as scrambles, which capture the ethos of the moment during a fight. Certainly, the duration of a fight spans approximately from 5 to 6 minutes. Within the duration of the fight, during the scramble window, the fight can completely change based on who is more engaged in the fight, patient, and making the correct reads during the fight. The aspect of scramble and patience can be extrapolated to the politics at work, or in a relationship, or opportunities with humans. In each type of scramble, we are forced to react in the moment, where awareness has to be present about the surroundings.</p>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">Place_holder</h2>
                        <p>As we got further and further away, it [the Earth] diminished in size. Finally it shrank to the size of a marble, the most beautiful you can imagine. That beautiful, warm, living object looked so fragile, so delicate, that if you touched it with a finger it would crumble and fall apart. Seeing this has to change a man.</p>
